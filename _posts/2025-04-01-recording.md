## Data Collection at University Hospital for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy Begins

We are pleased to announce that the data collection phase has officially begun at our partner institution, the University Hospital for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy. The study will involve 120 patients, with each patient attending six scheduled sessions.

Each session consists of:

- A medical-psychiatric interview

- A psychological interview

- Standardized clinical ratings

The data collection takes place in a specially equipped room, featuring state-of-the-art hardware for recording purposes. To ensure comprehensive data capture, three cameras are used during each session:

- One focusing on the patient

- One on the doctor or psychologist

- One monitoring the patient's gait when entering and leaving the room

The data collected will enable the extraction and analysis of various features for detailed behavioral and condition assessment. This includes:

- Facial expressions

- Head and body posture

- Emotions

- Gait analysis

- Vital signs

- Speech patterns

This initiative marks a significant step forward in our collaborative efforts to better understand psychiatric conditions and improve patient care through innovative technology and research.
