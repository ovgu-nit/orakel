# Deception Detection In virtual sales meetings
The ORAKEL project aims to use artificial intelligence (AI) to precisely identify early warning signs of depressive relapses, thus enabling timely intervention. By collecting multimodal data (video and audio recordings) and developing specific deep learning models, the project will analyse patients' behavioural patterns and emotional states. These innovative technologies will support clinical use via a user-friendly graphical interface and help to treat depressive episodes at an early stage.

The focus is on improving relapse prevention, optimising psychiatric care and relieving the burden on medical staff by means of intelligent assistance systems. The project combines expertise in psychiatry and AI development to create personalised approaches to depression treatment and to advance research in key digital technologies.
